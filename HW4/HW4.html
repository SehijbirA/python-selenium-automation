    <ol>
      <li>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.</li>
      <li>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk.</li>
      <li>Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. </li>
      <li>Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.</li>
      <li>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat.</li>
      <li>Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.</li>
